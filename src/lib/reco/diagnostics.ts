// Issue detection — the layer that turns DSP metrics into the cards the user sees.
// Pure (depends only on AudioAnalysis + GenreId), so it is unit-tested in diagnostics.test.ts.
// Genre-aware on purpose: score.ts judges the low/high gaps and loudness PER GENRE, so this
// detector uses the SAME genre target zones (genreById) — a verdict and its fix card can
// never contradict each other (the no-bluff invariant).
